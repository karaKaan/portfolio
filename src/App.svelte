        My passionate for Coding developed in the University. Not because what
        they have taught me, nor the courses that I chose. To explain that, I
        need to jump further into the past. In my High School years I chose an
        economic School. and in the University, I chose business administration.
        So my path for coding did not even start yet. I was dedicated to work as
        a tax consultant or a controller. Something that has nothing to do with
        Coding. But Things Changed. I wanted earn a bit of money and started
        with Affiliate, and Keyword Research was one thing that was important
        and yet a pain in the a**. My Brother told me to scrape those Keywords
        and the key figures. After looking around and researching, I developed a
        script in Python with the Library Selenium. That script scraped the
        keyword and the key figures and it pasted it into Google
        Spreadsheet.This little script took a loooooooot of work off me and
        saved a lot of time. The Affiliate Site wasn't successful, but I was
        happy about the new lesson that I've learned. That coding can simplify
        your life. I changed my study course to business informatics. The
        courses or rather the programming languages were versatile. So there was
        no real focus. At first I wanted to become a Data Scientist, but then I
        reevaluate my decision and chose to become a Full Stack Web
        Developer.Reasons for me to become a Web developer was: <br />ðŸ”¥
        Providing a Solution. <br />ðŸ”¥ Reaching a lot of People. <br />ðŸ”¥ Fun
        Factor and Visual Approvment.
