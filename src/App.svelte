      My passionate for Coding developed in the University. Not because what
      they have taught me, nor the courses that I chose. To explain that, I need
      to jump further into the past. In my High School years I chose an economic
      School. and in the University, I chose business administration. So my path
      for coding did not even start yet. I was dedicated to work as a tax
      consultant or a controller. Something that has nothing to do with Coding.
      But Things Changed. I wanted earn a bit of money and started with
      Affiliate, and Keyword Research was one thing that was important and yet a
      pain in the a**. My Brother told me to scrape those Keywords and the key
      figures. After looking around and researching, I developed a script in
      Python with the Library Selenium. That script scraped the keyword and the
      key figures and it pasted it into Google Spreadsheet.This little script
      took a loooooooot of work off me and saved a lot of time. The Affiliate
      Site wasn't successful, but I was happy about the new lesson that I've
      learned. That coding can simplify your life. I changed my study course to
      business informatics. The courses or rather the programming languages were
      versatile. So there was no real focus. At first I wanted to become a Data
      Scientist, but then I reevaluate my decision and chose to become a Full
      Stack Web Developer.Reasons for me to become a Web developer was: <br/>ðŸ”¥
      Providing a Solution. <br/>ðŸ”¥ Reaching a lot of People. <br/>ðŸ”¥ Fun Factor and
      Visual Approvment.
